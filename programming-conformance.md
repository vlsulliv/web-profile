
Conformance
Everything in this specification is normative except for diagrams, examples, notes and sections marked as being informative.

This specification depends on the Infra Standard. [INFRA]

The following conformance classes are defined by this specification:

conforming set of IDL fragments
A set of IDL fragments is considered to be a conforming set of IDL fragments if, taken together, they satisfy all of the must-, required- and shall-level criteria in this specification that apply to IDL fragments.

conforming implementation
A user agent is considered to be a conforming implementation relative to a conforming set of IDL fragments if it satisfies all of the must-, required- and shall-level criteria in this specification that apply to implementations for all language bindings that the user agent supports.

conforming ECMAScript implementation
A user agent is considered to be a conforming ECMAScript implementation relative to a conforming set of IDL fragments if it satisfies all of the must-, required- and shall-level criteria in this specification that apply to implementations for the ECMAScript language binding.
